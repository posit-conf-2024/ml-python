## Other communication (Discord)

You should have received an email with an invitation and instructions for joining the conference's discord server.

This workshop has a private channel under Workshops,

::: {.large style="text-align: center"}
#workshop-ml-python
:::

This is a great place to ask questions, post resources, memes, or most anything else before, during, and after the workshop.



# Computational Environment

## RStudio Cloud

Link in your welcome email (from last night!) and/or discord (pinned/first comment)

Once you have joined you're ready to go!
We will work with these at the end of each lecture component.

which should then create a copy of all materials and launch a cloud session for you.


## Cloud session

If everything is working you should see something very close to the following,
